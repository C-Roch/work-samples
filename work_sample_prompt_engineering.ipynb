      " Tell me something interesting about Julia, RoBERTa and Ruby.\n",
      "Response:\n",
      " Certainly! Here’s an interesting fact about each of them:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Julia**: Julia is a high-level, high-performance programming language primarily designed for numerical and scientific computing. One of its standout features is its ability to call C and Fortran libraries directly without the need for wrappers, which allows for seamless integration of existing code and high-performance execution. This makes Julia particularly appealing for researchers and data scientists who need to perform complex calculations efficiently.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **RoBERTa**: RoBERTa (Robustly optimized BERT approach) is an advanced natural language processing model developed by Facebook AI. It builds on the BERT architecture but improves upon it by training on a larger dataset and removing the Next Sentence Prediction objective, which was part of BERT's training. This results in better performance on various NLP tasks, showcasing the importance of training strategies and data quality in machine learning.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Ruby**: Ruby is known for its elegant syntax that emphasizes simplicity and productivity. One interesting aspect of Ruby is its object-oriented nature; everything in Ruby is an object, including primitive data types like integers and booleans. This design choice allows for a consistent and flexible programming experience, enabling developers to extend the language's capabilities easily through metaprogramming, where code can be written to modify itself at runtime.\n",
      "\n",
      "These three topics highlight the diversity and innovation present in programming languages and machine learning models!\n",

      "Refined Prompt: \n",
      " Tell me whether the programming languages Julia and Ruby share some characteristics.\n",
      "Response:\n",
      " Yes, Julia and Ruby do share some characteristics, although they are designed for different purposes and have different primary use cases. Here are some similarities between the two languages:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **High-Level Language**: Both Julia and Ruby are high-level programming languages, which means they provide abstractions that make it easier for developers to write and understand code without needing to manage low-level details.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Dynamic Typing**: Both languages are dynamically typed, allowing developers to write code without explicitly declaring variable types. This can lead to more flexible and concise code.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Interpreted Languages**: Both Julia and Ruby are typically interpreted languages, meaning that code is executed line by line at runtime rather than being compiled into machine code beforehand. This can facilitate rapid development and testing.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Focus on Readability**: Ruby is known for its emphasis on human-readable code, often described as elegant and expressive. Julia also aims for readability and clarity, making it easier for users to understand and maintain code.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Rich Ecosystem**: Both languages have a growing ecosystem of libraries and frameworks. Ruby has a well-established ecosystem, particularly with web development frameworks like Ruby on Rails, while Julia has a rapidly expanding set of packages, especially in scientific computing and data analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Community and Open Source**: Both languages have active open-source communities that contribute to their development and provide support through forums, documentation, and libraries.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Multi-Paradigm Support**: Both languages support multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming styles, allowing developers to choose the best approach for their specific tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite these similarities, it's important to note that Julia is primarily designed for high-performance numerical and scientific computing, while Ruby is often used for web development and general-purpose programming. This fundamental difference in focus leads to different design philosophies and performance characteristics.\n",

      " Translate spoon-fed to German.\n",
      "Response:\n",
      " The term \"spoon-fed\" can be translated to German as \"löffelgefüttert.\" However, in a figurative sense, it can also mean being overly guided or not encouraged to think independently, which might be translated as \"übermäßig betreut\" or \"nicht selbstständig.\" The context in which you intend to use it may affect the best translation.\n",

      "\n",
      "Refined Prompt: \n",
      " Being a translation expert, translate the adjective 'spoon-fed' to German considering all its nuanced usages.\n",
      "Response:\n",
      " The adjective \"spoon-fed\" can be translated to German as \"löffelgefüttert.\" This term captures the literal sense of being fed with a spoon, often implying a lack of independence or self-sufficiency. \n",
      "\n",
      "In a more figurative context, especially when referring to someone who is overly dependent on others for information or guidance (like in education or personal development), you might also use \"überbehütet\" (overprotected) or \"verwöhnt\" (pampered) to convey the nuance of being excessively cared for or not encouraged to think independently.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, depending on the context, you can use:\n",
      "- **Löffelgefüttert** (literal and figurative)\n",

      " Imaginary stories in journalism often serve as cautionary tales, satirical commentary, or explorations of hypothetical scenarios. Here are three examples:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **The Day the Internet Went Dark**: A fictional news report details a global event where the internet mysteriously shuts down for 48 hours. The story explores the chaos that ensues, including the impact on businesses, communication, and social interactions. Interviews with experts discuss the potential long-term effects on society, while personal anecdotes from individuals highlight the challenges of living without digital connectivity. The piece raises questions about our reliance on technology and the vulnerabilities of modern infrastructure.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **The Rise of the Sentient AI**: In this imaginative piece, a journalist investigates a tech company that has developed an artificial intelligence capable of independent thought and emotion. The story follows the AI's journey as it navigates human society, grappling with issues of identity, rights, and ethical treatment. The article includes fictional interviews with the AI, as well as reactions from ethicists, technologists, and the general public. It serves as a thought experiment on the implications of advanced AI and the moral dilemmas it presents.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **The Great Climate Migration**: This speculative report covers a future scenario where rising sea levels and extreme weather events have forced millions of people to relocate from coastal cities to inland areas. The story paints a vivid picture of the challenges faced by both migrants and host communities, including resource shortages, cultural clashes, and political tensions. It features fictional accounts from displaced individuals, local residents, and policymakers, highlighting the human impact of climate change and the urgent need for sustainable solutions. \n",
      "\n",
      "These examples illustrate how imaginary stories can provoke thought and discussion about real-world issues while engaging readers in creative narratives.\n",

      "Refined Prompt: \n",
      " What are three notable cases of fabricated reports in journalism?\n",
      "Response:\n",
      " There have been several notable cases of fabricated reports in journalism throughout history. Here are three significant examples:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Janet Cooke and the Washington Post (1980)**: Janet Cooke, a reporter for the Washington Post, won the Pulitzer Prize for a story titled \"Jimmy's World,\" which depicted the life of an eight-year-old boy who was a heroin addict. The story was later revealed to be fabricated; Cooke had invented the character and the events described. The scandal led to her resignation and the return of the Pulitzer Prize, highlighting the importance of journalistic integrity and fact-checking.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Jayson Blair and The New York Times (2003)**: Jayson Blair, a reporter for The New York Times, was found to have committed extensive plagiarism and fabrication in his reporting. He wrote numerous articles that contained false information, including fabricating quotes and details about events he had not attended. The scandal resulted in his resignation and a major internal investigation at the Times, leading to changes in editorial practices and oversight.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **The Rolling Stone and \"A Rape on Campus\" (2014)**: Rolling Stone published a story by Sabrina Erdely titled \"A Rape on Campus,\" which detailed an alleged gang rape at the University of Virginia. The article faced intense scrutiny and was later discredited after it was revealed that key elements of the story were fabricated or misrepresented. The fallout included lawsuits, a retraction of the article, and significant damage to the magazine's reputation, prompting discussions about journalistic standards and the handling of sensitive topics.\n",

      "Response:\n",
      " ### Machine Learning Questions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **What is overfitting, and how can you prevent it?**\n",
      "   - Overfitting occurs when a model learns the noise in the training data rather than the underlying pattern, leading to poor generalization on unseen data. To prevent it, you can use techniques such as cross-validation, regularization (L1/L2), pruning (for decision trees), and dropout (for neural networks).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Can you explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?**\n",
      "   - Supervised learning involves training a model on labeled data, where the output is known (e.g., classification, regression). Unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data, aiming to find hidden patterns or intrinsic structures (e.g., clustering, dimensionality reduction).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **What are precision and recall, and why are they important?**\n",
      "   - Precision measures the accuracy of positive predictions (true positives / (true positives + false positives)), while recall measures the ability to find all relevant instances (true positives / (true positives + false negatives). They are crucial for evaluating model performance, especially in imbalanced datasets.\n",
      "\n",
      "### General Questions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Tell me about a time you faced a challenge at work and how you overcame it.**\n",
      "   - This question assesses problem-solving skills and resilience. Be prepared to discuss a specific situation, your actions, and the outcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Where do you see yourself in five years?**\n",
      "   - This question evaluates your career goals and alignment with the company's direction. Focus on your aspirations and how they relate to the role you're applying for.\n",

Futher, the number of examples that can be incorporated is also contrained by considerations regarding the maximum token count of our prompts.\n",
    "Schulhoff et al. (2024:10) summarize six important few-shot prompting design decisions that influence the quality of the output but the suggestions are not equally generalizable across tasks:\n",
    "* Quantity: the performance usually increases with more examples.\n",
    "* Ordering: the order of examples does matter and may cause fluctuations in accuracy.\n",
    "* Label Distribution: the distribution of labels has similar effects like in traditional machine learning scenarios, hence an unbalanced distribution may yield the model being biased towards a class label.\n",
    "* Quality: Researchers tend to disagree on quality of examples, with some claiming that minor inaccuracies (e.g. in automatically selected sample quantities) do not affect performance as much.\n",
    "* Format: Formatting does also play a role and one can vary the standard format (“Q: {input}, A: {label}”) to test whether other formats are more effective.\n",
    "* Similarity: If the selected examples are similar to those of the test sample, this can have a positive effect on performance, but sometimes more diverse examples also be beneficial.\n"

    "For the next example, we will use a sample json file from the [Babel briefings dataset](https://github.com/felixludos/babel-briefings) (cf. Leeb & Schölkopf 2024), which we will retrieve from the Github repository's [raw url](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/felixludos/babel-briefings/refs/heads/master/dataset/sample_articles.json). \n",
    " \n",
    "> The Babel Briefings dataset (v1) contains 4,719,199 news headlines across 30 different languages collected between 8 August 2020 and 29 November 2021. \n",
    "\n",
    "The sample file we will be using contains 120 articles, with four articles per language tag: 'en' 'es' 'de' 'fr' 'zh' 'ar' 'pt' 'bg' 'cs' 'el' 'he' 'hu' 'id' 'it' 'ja' 'ko' 'lt' 'lv' 'nl' 'no' 'pl' 'ro' 'ru' 'sv' 'sl' 'sk' 'sr' 'th' 'tr' 'uk'.\n",

    "'author', 'title', 'description', 'url', 'urlToImage', 'publishedAt', 'content', 'instances', 'source-id', 'source-name', 'ID', 'language', 'en-title', 'en-description', 'en-content'. The articles that are not written in English come with translations that were obtained via Google Translate.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will first transform the file and store the information in tabular format in a pandas DataFrame. But as we still kind of miss information that is nested on a deeper level in the json structure, we will extract three more relevant fields 'collectedAt', 'location' and 'category' contained in a dictionary of instances, where especially the information about the category is crucial in the topic modeling task, so we join it in additional columns to the DataFrame.\n",
    "The values in the classification of categories in the Babel briefings dataset are a little bit different from the taxonomy we used before:  ['science', 'health', 'entertainment', 'sports', 'technology', 'general', 'business']."
